# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexandre

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** who specializes in building fast, responsive, and scalable web applications using **Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS**.

## 💻 What I Do

- **⚡ Frontend Development**  
  I craft clean, interactive UIs using React and Next.js. From landing pages to full web apps, I build pixel-perfect interfaces with reusable components and modern performance practices like SSR and SSG.

- **🔧 Backend Development**  
  I build scalable backends with Supabase and Node.js. Real-time data, secure auth, REST APIs, and business logic that just works.

- **🎨 Figma to Code**  
  I bring your designs to life with precision—animations, layout, spacing, and flow all matched down to the pixel.

- **🍃 Tailwind CSS UI**  
  I use utility-first styling to create sleek, modern layouts that are responsive, accessible, and scalable.

- **🌀 Animation & 3D**  
  I use Framer Motion and React Three Fiber to deliver smooth animations and stunning interactive visuals that enhance UX without hurting performance.
